I have the best parents in the world. Both of them are understanding, kind and patient. They always support me and give me sound advice. My
mother and I are very much alike. She is very beautiful and elegant and always inspires me. My dad is a surgeon. Every day he saves lives of many people. I am happy to have such a friendly family. On our weekends we often go to the country and stay with my grandparents. I help my
grandma with gardening or go fishing with my granddad. My grandparents are retired but work part-time as teachers at school. We love to make up picnics. My father usually cooks shish kebab and grilled vegetables. We often sit up late at night and look through our family albums. I can sit for hours studying cach image and recalling life events. It is so touching.
