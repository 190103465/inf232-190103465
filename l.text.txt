As to my appearance, I am quite tall and slim with big blue eyes and plump lips. My hair is curly and brown. I have lightly tanned skin. My friends find me rather attractive. Like most teenagers, I prefer wearing casual clothing, such as jeans, T-shirts and sneakers. I hate high-heeled shoes because they are extremely uncomfortable. I usually feel uneasy when I have to wear them on special occasions.
